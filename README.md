## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this challenge I learned to mimic UI from figma. I also learned to UI handle different screen size and finally implemented flexbox.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  flex-grow: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

In my future project I will focus on media-query to handle responsive UI for smaller devices. Write clear HTML.

### Useful resources
